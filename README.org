#+Title: Emacs Directory

My emacs settings directory

* No init.elc
Compile init.el separately; init.elc is excluded from repo

* No Packages
All packages are not included with repo, to save space i guess, will have to figure out a way to dump a list of install packages and create a checksum and redownload missing packages.
